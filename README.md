Bootcamp Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge - Text Editor

## Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor
In this project, we were asked to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria and it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

This is a class project so we are submitting the same code.
